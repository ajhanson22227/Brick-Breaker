# Brick Breaker

This is a simple version of the game Brick Breaker
A ball will bounce around the screen and break the bricks it interacts with.
The player controls a paddle at the botton to catch the ball and bounce it back up.
If the ball hits the bottom of the screen, the game is over.

## Motivation

I got the idea to re-create this game when I was learning the SFML library for c++. It was good practice for OOP with the ball, paddlem and brick interactions.

## Built with

    * C++
    * SFML

## Installation

Download the repository and in the terminal run `make` to compile the files. Then start the application by running `./game`.
